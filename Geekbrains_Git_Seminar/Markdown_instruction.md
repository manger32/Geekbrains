# Markdown Work Instruction (MWI)

## Text formatting

> To format a text using *Italic*, you need to surround it with <br> asterisks ( * text * ) or with both-hand underscore sign (_ text _).

For example, *My Project* or like this: _My Project_

> To format a text Half-Bolded, you need to surround it with <br> double asterisks ( ** _ ** ). or with both-hand double underscore sign (__ text __)

For example, **My Project** or like this: __My Project__

> Alternative methods of indenting a text with a right curly braces (>) sign

For example:

> - LE GRANGE

> Text may also be formatted as both _Italic_ and __Bold__. 

Like this: *__Italic, Bold__*

For example, **My Project**

## Lists

> To add non-enumerated lists, you need to create <br> marked paragraphs with asterisks (*) or with a sign (+). 

For example:
* Daughter #1 under Charles Smith
* Daughter #2 under Mel Jackobson
* Daughter #3 on top of Ted Lerroy
+ Daughter #4 on the head of Derek Nimoy

> To add enumerated lists, you need to add numbers every newline

1. Daughter #1 learns on ulearn.me
2. Daughter #2 learns on markered

> To add terminology glossarium, start with: 

**Term 1**

:   Definition 1

**Midterm**

:   **RIP YOUR OPEL**

**Term 2**

:   *Definition 2*
